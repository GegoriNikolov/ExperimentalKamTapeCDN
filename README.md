# KamTape CDN
The code that makes up v***.kamtape.com, a.k.a all the KamTape CDNs.
All media is neatly tucked into the /data/ folder where you can choose from two directories, /videos/ for videos, and /thmbs/ for thumbnails.
Setup is fairly simple, put this on an open internet domain, then edit /my_videos_upload_post.php in the KamTape source code to use it.
Simple as pie :)
